Finding out voting information for each county using Python
# 1. Purpose of the election audit
The purpose of this project is to check the election results. The purpose of this module was to learn how to read csv files in python and begin to run the data with our coding skills. We used the data file provided to determine how many votes each candidate received to help determine a winner. In the module 3 challenge we use provided data to determine the total votes and percentage of each county to find which county is the largest.
